# Homework 2 - Music

## Part the first
Create an object model for the following problem domain:

- There are human musicians that have names.
- There are bands that have names and more than one musician.
- A single musician can be a member of multiple bands
- Bands and musicians (artists) can publish music albums (more than one).
- Albums have a title and publication date
- Songs have a title and a duration

You need to declare classes, interfaces, and helper objects that would enable us to do the following operations:

1. Create a new musician
2. Create a new band
3. Assign a musician to a band
4. Remove a musician from a band
5. List all the musicians in a given band
5. Create a new album for a given artist
6. List all the albums for a given artist
7. Add a new song to a given album
8. List all the songs for a given album

Use the created objects to create an application that will allow us to enter at least three artists, at least one of which is a band, with at least three albums each, with at least three songs each.
